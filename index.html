      <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
      <p>I am in 11th grade. I spend most of my time playing and watching sports, listening to music, and napping. I live with my Mom, Dad and my only younger brother. </p>

    <p> My binary Search Game is a NFl team Guesser that can guess any NFL team you are thinking of with 4 simple questions! This project was a group collaboration project and I worked with one other person. Our Program was made up of a LOT of IF statements for each team in each divison.  <a href="https://68d9d4ad-3c0b-48aa-94f1-b34a2c4b0437-00-2xqgi9t51tr99.picard.replit.dev/">Binary Search NFL Game</a> </p> 
     

      <h3>My Projects using HTML</h3>
      <p>I have made a portfolio website using HTML. This website is a portfolio of my projects. I made sure to first add all the information about me and my projects, then focused on adding animations and cool background effects. I hosted my webpage with github and I worked with code sourse repositories by summarizing changes made to my webpage. I worked with HTML, CSS and JS to add my information and add cool animations to my webpage. To get my animations I had to research 3rd party javascript libraries that had code examples to be able to add the animations to my webpage.  </p></p>


  <h3>My projects using TypeScript:</h3>
    <p>I collaboratively created a Christmas theme word seach game using lists, iterations, variables,strings, and react all in TypeScript. This is a link to my publshed Word Search Game using react. 
    <a href="https://jovial-nougat-f95968.netlify.app/">React Word Seach </a> and my link to a full reflection of the process of making the game <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qMswIOIbZH5sywIiCpJydD4btn_lMuVx86OlRKlUUEY/edit#heading=h.wuiaylb4jiim/"> Mash Game reflection</a></p>
    
   <h3>Image Filter Project</h3>
    <p>I created a set of 4 different filters to apply on images, I displayed my knowledge of creating image filters by changing values of pixels, identfying positions of pixels with certin colors and adding interactive optons to customize the filter straight on the webpage. This is a link to my published image filter webpage . 
    <a href="https://tristan-leng-imagefilterproject.netlify.app/"> Image Filter page </a> </p>

    <p>This is a link to a code that was used to create my "Border" filter <a href= "https://bookish-waddle-pjr4677v4p592659q.github.dev/"> "Border" Filter Code </a></p>
      <p>This code used most of my knowledge of how to create a image. The image filter consisted of code that used an indexer, a way of identifying positions of certain pixels on the image. I also used if statements to make sure the indexer was choosing which certain pixels i wanted to be a color of my choice. At first grabbed the first 150 pixels in the rows and the columns. Then I grabbed the last 150 pixels in the rows and the columns. I set all chosen red, green, blue and alpha pixels and set them to black. This would make it so that when I applied the filter to the image the border around the image would be a solid black color. I decided to incorperate an option code to allow the tester to change the color of the border. I first needed to define my option and add it into the code, then changed the color value of the pixels chosen to R,G,B instead of 0,0,0 to allow the border to be any color chosen on the color chart on the webpage. This filter shows the most of my understanding of how to manipulate and edit pixel data of an image to create an Image Filter. </p>
