    <p> My binary Search Game is a NFl team Guesser that can guess any NFL team you are thinking of with 4 simple questions! This project was a group collaboration project and I worked with one other person. Our Program was made up of a LOT of IF statements for each team in each divison.  <a href="https://binary-search-game-group-project-iacs-apcsp-23-24-2.iacs-apcsp-23-24.repl.co/">Binary Search NFL Game</a> </p> 
     

      <h3>My Projects using HTML</h3>
      <p>I have made a portfolio website using HTML. This website is a portfolio of my projects. I made sure to first add all the information about me and my projects, then focused on adding animations and cool background effects. I hosted my webpage with github and I worked with code sourse repositories by summarizing changes made to my webpage. I worked with HTML, CSS and JS to add my information and add cool animations to my webpage. To get my animations I had to research 3rd party javascript libraries that had code examples to be able to add the animations to my webpage.  </p></p>


  <h3>My projects using TypeScript:</h3>
    <p>I collaboratively created a Christmas theme word seach game using lists, iterations, variables,strings, and react all in TypeScript. This is a link to my publshed Word Search Game using react.
